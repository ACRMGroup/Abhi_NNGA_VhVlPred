for every interface position

1) Write the interface position itno a temporary file

2) run program create_intermediate_file.sh to create the intermediate file for
   the single interface position.

3) run program final.exe to create the pattern file, validation file, and produce
   an error for the boot strapping procedure.

There are problems with some positions not being interface positions in all the antibody
structures. Take only positions that appear in all antibodies as interface positions.

Modifications: In the overall script, add a parameter to accept a file that contains
	       the numbering for all structures. Run a grep for every position in
	       this file. If number of results returned is 481, then proceed with
	       remaining steps. Else, skip to the next structure.
