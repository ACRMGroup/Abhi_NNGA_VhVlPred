General trends suggest that high mutation rates lead to a quick
saturation in the population of parent genes.

7th May, 12:00 AM - So far, I have tried both random mutations and
mutations at every position. With both low and high mutation rates,
the problems are the same - saturation in genes after a certain level.
The GA refuses to progress after that point.

Alternatives that I have to try:

1) See trends of when the saturation starts to creep in. See if you
   can make associations between the average correlation coefficient,
   the standard deviation and the point at which saturation starts.

2) Try reducing the overall mutation rate and run the GA for a 100 rounds
   - THIS IS TO BE DONE TONIGHT.

3) Further, programs to analyze the way the correlation coefficient moves
   over 100 generations. Use a correlation coefficient of 0.0005.
