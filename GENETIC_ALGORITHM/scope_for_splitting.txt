Scheme -

1) Read PDB list

2) Create the fold ranges.

3) Read the interface positions.

4) Read interface angles

5) Read Kabat numbering into a set of linked listss.

6) assign SNNS filenames.

7) initialise parent population of genes.

8) Score every parent gene - **** SCOPE FOR PARALLELIZATION *****
   |
   |
   |------------------> Score gene against 5 folds
					|--------------> Score gene against every fold

9) Create the child genes based on scores of parent genes.

10) Calculate the scores of child genes.

11) Select the best genes in the given pool of parent and child genes.


SCORING A GENE AGAINST A FOLD -> REQUIREMENTS.
-----------------------------

1) Get the interface positions into an array

2) Get the Kabat numbered residues into a set of linked lists.

3) Find the residues at interface positions.

4) Read the matrix representing the residue properties.

5) Construct a matrix representing the residues at the interface positions.

6) Create the intermediate file.

7) Read the intermediate file
